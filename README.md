##  Feature Breakdown

###  Objective

This section details the core features implemented in the **Airbnb Clone** backend and how they contribute to the functionality of the platform.

---

### 👤 User Management

This feature enables secure registration, login, and profile management for both guests and hosts. It ensures that users are authenticated and authorized to perform actions based on their role (e.g., booking properties or listing them as a host).

---

### 🏘️ Property Management

Hosts can create, update, delete, and retrieve property listings. Each property includes details such as title, description, pricing, and availability, forming the foundation for the booking experience.

---

### 📅 Booking System

Guests can search for available properties and reserve them for specific dates. The system handles check-in and check-out information, and ensures that bookings do not overlap.

---

### 💳 Payment Processing

Handles secure transaction flows for bookings. Once a booking is made, payment details are captured and processed, ensuring financial tracking and confirmation of reservations.

---

### ⭐ Review System

Guests can leave feedback and rate properties after their stay. This fosters trust and transparency within the platform, helping users make informed booking decisions.

---

### 🚀 API Access (REST & GraphQL)

The backend exposes both REST and GraphQL endpoints for flexible data access and integration. This allows for easy interaction with frontend clients or third-party tools.

---

### 📈 Data Optimization

Incorporates indexing and caching to improve performance, especially for read-heavy operations like property browsing or booking history lookups.



##  API Security

###  Objective

This section highlights the key security measures implemented in the **Airbnb Clone** backend to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain platform integrity.

---

###  Authentication

All API endpoints are protected using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth2). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

> **Why it's important**: Authentication prevents attackers from impersonating users and accessing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.

---

###  Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to distinguish what actions users can take based on their role (e.g., host vs. guest). For instance, only hosts can list properties, and only guests can book them.

> **Why it's important**: Ensures that users can only access and modify data they are permitted to, preventing privilege escalation and data leaks.

---

### Rate Limiting

To mitigate abuse and brute-force attacks, rate limiting is applied to sensitive endpoints like login and registration. This restricts how many times a user or IP can make requests in a given timeframe.

> **Why it's important**: Prevents API overuse, helps defend against DDoS attacks, and reduces exposure to credential stuffing attacks.

---

###  Secure Payment Handling

Sensitive financial operations are protected using secure HTTPS communication and integration with trusted third-party payment processors. Payment data is never stored in plain text.

> **Why it's important**: Secures financial transactions and protects users from fraud, chargebacks, and data theft.

---

### 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization

All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

> **Why it's important**: Prevents attackers from manipulating queries or injecting malicious scripts that could compromise the system.

---

### 🧰 Other Best Practices

* HTTPS enforced across all environments.
* Environment variables used for storing secrets and API keys.
* Regular security audits and dependency vulnerability scans.



## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### 🎯 Objective

This section provides an overview of the **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline and its role in streamlining the development and deployment lifecycle for the Airbnb Clone backend.

---

### 🚧 What is CI/CD?

CI/CD is a set of automated processes that allow developers to integrate code changes frequently, test those changes continuously, and deploy them reliably.

* **Continuous Integration (CI)** automatically builds and tests the application every time code is pushed to the repository.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ensures that the latest version of the application is automatically deployed to a staging or production environment once it passes all tests.

---

### ✅ Why It's Important

* **Faster Development Cycles**: Automates testing and deployment, allowing rapid iteration.
* **Improved Code Quality**: Catches bugs early through automated testing.
* **Consistent Deployments**: Reduces the risk of human error during releases.
* **Team Collaboration**: Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute without conflict.

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing, building, and deploying code directly from GitHub.
* **Docker**: Ensures consistency across environments by containerizing the application.
* **Docker Compose**: Used for managing multi-container Docker applications during local development and testing.
* **AWS ** *(optional)*: used as deployment
* **pytest / Django Test Suite**: Used for running automated tests during the CI phase.
